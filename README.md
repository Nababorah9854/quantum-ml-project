# Quantum ML Project
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models for Image Classification

## Description
This project combines classical CNNs with quantum circuits to efficiently classify sea animal images.  
We experiment with hybrid quantum-classical models using Python, PyTorch, and Pennylane to improve classification accuracy on small datasets.

## Dataset
Sea Animals Image Dataset (link if available)

## Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, Pennylane, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Features
- Hybrid Quantum-Classical CNN model
- Classical CNN baseline for comparison
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline
- Accuracy & confusion matrix visualization

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
